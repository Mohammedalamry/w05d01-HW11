## Read Ruby on Rails Guide to answer the questions below:
**[Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)**
- Apply your knowledge of Ruby on rails to answer these questions.

## Questions
1. What is Active Record?
Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic.

2. What is MVC?

One common way of dividing up these four responsibilities is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. This pattern involves making three core types of components, each responsible for a different part of the server's functionality.

A Model directly manages the data in our application, and provides a representation of that data for the rest of the application to use.

A View is like it sounds - it's data that gets sent back to the client for the user to consume.

A Controller responds to user requests as they come in, and utilizes both the model and the view components to perform the desired behavior and produce a response.
3. What is REST-ful routing?

it  is relationship between  client and server   
which provide map between server and actions such as creat ,delet ,update ,read


4. What are migration files and why do we need them?
 Migrations are a convenient way for you to alter your database in a structured and organized manner.
 1.Active Record tracks 
 2update your db/schema.
 3.Migrations also allow you to describe these transformations using Ruby.


5. What does the `rails routes` do?
indicate to the server which controllers should be triggered (and how) by which kinds of requests. It's a critical piece of the puzzle, and one we'll be looking at later today in more detail.

6. Walk us through the setup and code for building a new rails app in Rails.
